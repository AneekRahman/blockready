### What is this?

BlockReady is a JavaScript library which if needed, can initiate basic, modern looking styling for all elements. You won't have to worry about styling ever again. Just like in markdown? :D

The library also has callbacks for event listening. The syntax is very readable and easy to maintain.

This library extends on a sister-library integrated in it called: <a href="https://github.com/AneekRahman/jstyling">JStyling</a>. It's the easiest way to write CSS in JavaScript!

<p style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)">Also help the development by reporting any bugs. Feel free to contribute to this project. Thanks ‚ù§</p>

### Examples

### Benefits

- Extremely lightweight: Only 72kB (19kB gzipped)

- Just one blockready.js file. No CSS FILE REQUIRED!
- Choose from a theme library (coming soon...)
